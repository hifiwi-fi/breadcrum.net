Feeds turn your bookmarks into private podcast feeds. The default feed includes all ready episodes. You can subscribe from any podcast app.

See [📼 Episodes docs](/docs/episodes/) to learn how episodes are created and appear in your feed.

## How feeds work

Episodes created from bookmarks appear in your feed once they are ready. The feed URL is private and includes a token, so keep it secret.

## Get your feed URL

1. Visit [📡 Feeds](/feeds/).
2. Copy the feed URL shown at the top.
3. Paste it into your podcast app as a "follow by URL" or custom feed.

## Search feeds

Use the feed search box to jump into [🔎 episode search](/search/episodes/) for the current query.

See the [📡 Feeds page](/feeds/) to manage your feed.
