Tags help you group and find related bookmarks. Tags show up on bookmarks, and you can filter or search by them across your library.

See the [🏷️ Tags page](/tags/) to browse your tag list.

## How tags work

Tags are stored on bookmarks. Archives and episodes inherit their parent bookmark’s tags for filtering and search. You can add tags manually, or accept the tag suggestions that come from bookmarklet metadata.

## Add tags

- In the bookmark editor, enter tags separated by spaces.
- Save the bookmark to apply them.

## Browse tags

Visit the [tags page](/tags/) to see all tags and jump into filtered bookmark lists.

## Edit or remove tags

Edit the bookmark, update the tag list, and save. Removing all tags clears the tag list for that bookmark.
