## 👷‍♂️ Early access

Breadcrum is still early in development and is not feature complete!

### ⚠️ Data Safety

Breadcrum is still an early access product, so data guarantees are slightly reduced.

- Data is backed up nightly.
- Hardware failure is a rare, but real reality.
- If hardware failure occurs, at worst, the last 24 hours or less of data could be lost.
- Service availability could be affected by hosting downtime during early access.
- High availability and redundant data guarantees will be offered for paid accounts when available.
- High availability and multi-region service points will be added for paid accounts when available.
