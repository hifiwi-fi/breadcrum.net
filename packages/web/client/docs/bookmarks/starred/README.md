Stars are a lightweight way to mark bookmarks you want to surface. Starred bookmarks can be filtered across bookmarks, archives, and episodes views.

You can toggle the starred filter from the top navbar (star icon) on any signed-in page.

See [🔖 Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) to use starred filters and manage your list.

## How it works

Stars are a bookmark flag. Toggling a star updates the bookmark immediately and affects related archive and episode lists when you enable the starred filter.

## Star a bookmark

- From any bookmark card, click the star icon (☆ → ★).
- Or edit the bookmark and check "starred".

## Use the starred filter

Enable the starred filter in list or search views to show only items whose bookmarks are starred. This filter applies to archives and episodes as well because they inherit their parent bookmark’s flags.

## Remove a star

Click the star icon again or uncheck "starred" in the bookmark edit form.
