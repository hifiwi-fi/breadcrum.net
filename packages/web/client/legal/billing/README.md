This page describes how billing and refunds work on {{ vars.siteName }} ("{{ vars.siteName }}", "we", "our").
By using any paid services, you agree to the terms outlined here.

---

## 1. Free and Paid Subscriptions

{{ vars.siteName }} offers a free tier and a paid subscription.
The free tier includes 10 new bookmarks per month, resetting on the 1st of each month (UTC).
The paid subscription offers unlimited bookmarks and is billed yearly.
Current subscription details are published on the [subscriptions and pricing](/docs/subscriptions/) page.

---

## 2. Subscription Billing

Subscriptions are charged on a yearly recurring basis.
You will be notified in advance of any price changes.
You can cancel your subscription at any time from your [account settings](/account/).
Canceling prevents future charges but does not retroactively refund past payments.
You retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period.

---

## 3. Payment Processing

Payments are processed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
We do not store your full payment details on our servers.
Billing data is securely transmitted and stored by Stripe.
You can manage your payment method and view invoices through the Stripe customer portal, accessible from your account settings.

---

## 4. Refunds

We offer good-faith refunds on a case-by-case basis.
To request a refund, email us at [{{ vars.supportEmail }}](mailto:{{ vars.supportEmail }}) with:
- The email address associated with your account
- A brief explanation of the issue
- The date and amount of the charge (if available)

Refund requests must be made within 14 days of the charge.
We reserve the right to deny refunds if we detect abuse, fraud, or repeated refund requests.

---

## 5. Failed Payments and Account Status

If your payment fails, we may:
- Retry the charge automatically
- Limit access to paid features
- Notify you via email to update your billing info

We will not delete your data due to payment failure.
