This page describes how billing and refunds work on {{ vars.siteName }} ("{{ vars.siteName }}", "we", "our").
By using any paid services, you agree to the terms outlined here.

---

## 1. Free and Paid Plans

Breadcrum currently offers a free plan to all users.
Paid plans may be introduced in the future.
If so, clear pricing and billing details will be published on the site and during signup.

---

## 2. Subscription Billing

When active, paid plans will be charged on a recurring basis (e.g. monthly or annually).
You will be notified in advance of any price changes.
You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings.
Canceling prevents future charges but does not retroactively refund past payments.

---

## 3. Payment Processing

Payments are processed by a third-party provider (e.g. Stripe).
We do not store your full payment details on our servers.
Billing data is securely transmitted and stored by the payment processor.

---

## 4. Refunds

We offer good-faith refunds on a case-by-case basis.
To request a refund, email us at [{{ vars.supportEmail }}](mailto:{{ vars.supportEmail }}) with:
- The email address associated with your account
- A brief explanation of the issue
- The date and amount of the charge (if available)

Refund requests must be made within 14 days of the charge.
We reserve the right to deny refunds if we detect abuse, fraud, or repeated refund requests.

---

## 5. Failed Payments and Account Status

If your payment fails, we may:
- Retry the charge automatically
- Limit access to paid features
- Notify you via email to update your billing info

We will not delete your data due to payment failure.
