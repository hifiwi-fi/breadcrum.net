Search lets you query bookmarks, archives, and episodes by keyword.

## How search works

Each resource has its own search page and filter options. Search respects your current flags (starred, to-read, sensitive) from the top navbar.

## Search pages

- 🔎 [Bookmark search](/search/bookmarks/)
- 🔎 [Archive search](/search/archives/)
- 🔎 [Episode search](/search/episodes/)
