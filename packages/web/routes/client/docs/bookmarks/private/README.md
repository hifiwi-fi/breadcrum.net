Sensitive mode marks bookmarks as extra private. These bookmarks can be hidden or revealed as a group using the sensitive toggle in list and search views.

You can toggle sensitive visibility from the top navbar (sensitive icon) on any signed-in page.

See [🔖 Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) to toggle sensitive visibility and manage your list.

## How it works

Sensitive is a bookmark flag. When it is on, the bookmark (and its archives/episodes) is treated as private content. Toggle the sensitive filter to include or hide these items across bookmarks, archives, episodes, feeds, and search.

## Mark a bookmark as private

- From any bookmark card, click the sensitive icon.
- Or edit the bookmark and check "sensitive".

## Use the sensitive filter

Use the sensitive toggle in list or search views to show or hide sensitive items. This is a visibility filter, not an additional password.

## Clear the flag

Click the sensitive icon again or uncheck "sensitive" in the bookmark edit form.
