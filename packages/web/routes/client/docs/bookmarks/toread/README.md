Read it later is a bookmark flag for articles you plan to come back to. It helps you separate “save for later” links from everything else.

You can toggle the to-read filter from the top navbar (circle icon) on any signed-in page.

See [🔖 Bookmarks](/bookmarks/) to use the to-read filter and manage your list.

## How it works

The to-read flag is stored on the bookmark. Turning it on updates the bookmark immediately and can be used as a filter across bookmarks, archives, and episodes.

## Mark a bookmark to read

- From any bookmark card, click the to-read icon (◯ → ●).
- Or edit the bookmark and check "to read".

## Use the to-read filter

Enable the to-read filter in list or search views to show only items whose bookmarks are marked to read. This filter applies to archives and episodes too.

## Clear the flag

Click the to-read icon again or uncheck "to read" in the bookmark edit form.
