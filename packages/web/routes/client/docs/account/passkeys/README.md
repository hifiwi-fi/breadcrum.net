Passkeys let you sign in with your device instead of a password. They are faster and resistant to phishing.

See the [⚙️ Account page](/account/) to manage passkeys.

## Add a passkey

1. Go to your [account page](/account/).
2. Choose "Add passkey" and follow the prompt from your browser or device.
3. Name it so you can recognize the device later.

## Sign in with a passkey

On the [login page](/login/), choose the passkey option when your browser prompts. On supported browsers, you may see an automatic prompt.

## Manage passkeys

From your [account page](/account/) you can rename or delete passkeys at any time.

## Requirements

- A passkey-capable browser (recent Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox).
- A device with a secure screen lock (PIN, fingerprint, or face unlock).

## Troubleshooting

- If the prompt does not appear, refresh the login page and try again.
- If you removed a passkey from your device, delete it in your account to keep the list clean.

Passwords still work as a fallback if you do not want to use passkeys.
